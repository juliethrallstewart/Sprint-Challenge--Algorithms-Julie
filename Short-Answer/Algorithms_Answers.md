#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(c^n) = exponential 

In excercise a, depending on the initial size of n its rate of growth is 3 times itself
depending on if a changes, this could run forever in a loop


b)
O(log n)

The variable J grows by double each time until the condition is met and stop, this
decreases the rate of time it takes to complete looping through the range each time
the loop runs


c) O(n)

For the number of times bunny(n) is reduced is 1 operation each time on the bunny(n)
and this is a constant, 5 bunnies? 5 operations



## Exercise II

#O(n) .. the number of operations is equal to the number of eggs thrown
#O(log n) .. use a binary search to find if the floor is f or before or after f,
#if the floor is f, try again for a different floor,
#don't drop the egg until you're on a floor less than f




def building(stories, n):

  eggs = n
  broken = n
  not_broken = n
  floorf = n
  #  # every time it's time to drop an egg, find if the floor is before or after f

  random number for floor = check floor = > drop egg if the floor is < f, store results
 
  

  return broken,not_broken
